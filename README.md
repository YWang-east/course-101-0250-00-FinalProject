# Final project for course "Solving PDEs in Parallel on GPUs"

[![CI action](https://github.com/YWang-east/course-101-0250-00-FinalProject/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/YWang-east/course-101-0250-00-FinalProject/actions/workflows/CI.yml)

[ðŸ‘† Make sure to include unit and reference tests. We provide you with a [reference test](/test/part1.jl) (using [ReferenceTests.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTesting/ReferenceTests.jl)) you can benchmark your implementation against. Adapt it to your needs and ensure your 3D diffusion solver to return `H_g` and `Xc_g`, the global solution array and the global x-coord vector, respectively.]

[Add some short info here about the project, an abstract in a sense, and link to the documentation for [**Part-1**](/docs/part1.md) and [**Part-2**](/docs/part2.md).]
