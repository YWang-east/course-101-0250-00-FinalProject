# Final Project Repo

[![Build Status](https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/FinalProjectRepo.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/eth-vaw-glaciology/FinalProjectRepo.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

[ðŸ‘† Make sure to include unit and reference tests. We provide you with a [reference test](/test/part1.jl) (using [ReferenceTests.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTesting/ReferenceTests.jl)) you can benchmark your implementation against. Adapt it to your needs and ensure your 3D diffusion solver to return `H_g` and `Xc_g`, the global solution array and the global x-coord vector, respectively.]

[Add some short info here about the project, an abstract in a sense, and link to the documentation for [**Part-1**](/docs/part1.md) and [**Part-2**](/docs/part2.md).]
